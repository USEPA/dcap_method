* `DCAP_Output_2025-07-17_with_variable_UFD.xlsx`: Excel file containing the standard DCAP results, but utilizes variable UFD values to calculate CTVs.

**NOTE:** The `HD50` column name in "DCAP_Output_2025-07-17_with_variable_UFD.xlsx" and "DCAP_Output_2025-07-17.xlsx" is the former variable for `p.calib.eBMD`.  The code has been updated to consistently utilize `p.calib.eBMD`.
